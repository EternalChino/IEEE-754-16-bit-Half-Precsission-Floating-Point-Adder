# IEEE-754-16-bit-Half-Precsission-Floating-Point-Adder

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
To successfully complete the project, you must design and implement an IEEE 754 half-precision
floating-point adder on the DE10-Lite

INPUT REQUIREMENTS
1. Inputs must be entered on the CSE 4 x 4 HEX KeyPad shown in Figure 4.
2. Inputs must be entered in binary in IEEE 754 half-precision floating-point format as they would be
   stored in memory. That is the hidden bit should not be entered explicitly.
3. Operand A should be entered by keying in the number and pressing Key 2 on the HexBoard
4. Operand B should be entered by keying in the number and pressing Key 3 on the HexBoard
5. Results R should be computed by pressing Key 4 on the HexBoard


DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS
1. Operand A must be displayed in hex according to the IEEE 754 half-precision format on the
   HexBoard when entered.
2. Operand B must be displayed in the same fashion when entered.
3. Results R must be displayed in hex in IEEE 754 half-precision format on the HexBoard
